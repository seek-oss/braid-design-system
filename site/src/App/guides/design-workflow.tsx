          This guide is presented as a series of questions that you might
          reasonably ask if you’re trying to leverage Braid during a typical
          product design workflow.

        <Heading level="3">How do I get started with a new concept?</Heading>
        <Text>
          All design tools are still at your disposal. Paper and pencil, Sketch,
          Axure, Keynote... whatever you like! Iterate quickly. Don’t feel like
          you need to get overly hung up on Braid early in the design process.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          That said, regardless of your tool of choice, it’s a good idea to
          familiarise yourself with our current component suite before getting
          started. Using existing patterns will always be faster than defining
          new ones.
        </Text>

        <Heading level="3">Is there a library for Sketch/Figma/etc.?</Heading>
        <Text>
          No. Braid is a living component system that’s designed to run in
          production, as opposed to being a static design library.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Our objective with Braid is not to improve the quality of our mock
          ups, but rather to optimise the design workflow around the layer that
          our users actually interact with.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Don’t feel like you need to meticulously recreate existing components
          in your mock ups. One of the major advantages of a design system like
          Braid is that it allows you to operate much more quickly during
          earlier stages of the design process.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Braid also provides many features that are simply not supported by
          traditional design tools, including:

          How do I leverage Braid in my design process?
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          The best way to make use of Braid is for designers and developers to
          work closer together, and much earlier in the process than we
          typically have in the past. Braid’s primary goal is to enable you to
          design directly in the final medium, rather than constantly (and
          expensively!) translating from one medium to another.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          To help empower this workflow, we’ve provided {playroomLink} as a tool
          for rapidly prototyping with Braid. In this environment, you have
          access to the entire suite of components, along with an instant
          preview across a variety of screen sizes and brands.
        </Text>

        <Heading level="3">
          What is {playroomLink}? Why should I use it?
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          {playroomLink} is a browser-based design tool that allows for
          real-time prototyping with interactive components, ensuring designers
          and developers are working together in the same medium, collaborating
          on the end product rather than handing off from one medium to another.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          If something already exists in Braid, it’s generally much more
          efficient to prototype with the components directly. As you iterate,
          you’ll be able to see how layouts react across different screen
          resolutions and brands, which is something that static design tools
          are simply unable to do.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          {playroomLink} deliberately rewards reuse of existing components.
          Creating something from scratch is harder than reaching for an
          existing pattern, and this is by design. While at first glance this
          might seem like an issue, this is actually an important step forwards
          in regards to design consistency, build quality, and speed of
          delivery.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Because {playroomLink} runs in the browser, you can easily share your
          work with others by copying and pasting the URL. It’s also open source
          and publicly available, which means you don’t need an account to
          create, view or edit designs. If you have any questions about
          something you’re working on, drop a link in {braidDesignSupportLink}{' '}
          so we can help you out.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Once you’re happy with a prototype in {playroomLink}, moving it into
          your application shouldn’t require much work at all since it’s built
          with the design system itself. This is in stark contrast to the
          traditional process of manually translating from Sketch/Figma/etc.
          which is typically slow and error prone.
        </Text>

        <Heading level="3">Do I need to write code?</Heading>
        <Text>
          Not necessarily. You might prefer to pair up with a developer to
          iterate on your designs together. It’s entirely up to you.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          That said, Braid and {playroomLink} are specifically designed to be
          approachable for non-developers. While they may seem more intimidating
          than most design tools at first glance, we’ve worked hard to keep the
          learning curve as low as possible and to minimise the amount of
          knowledge required to be productive.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          This might sound like a massive change, but we’re hoping that it’s not
          as big of a jump as you might think. Braid components allow you to
          work with high-level design-centric terms like{' '}
          <Link to="/components/Text">Text</Link>,{' '}
          <Link to="/components/Card">Card</Link> and{' '}
          <Link to="/components/Columns">Columns</Link>, rather than the
          low-level technical details of HTML and CSS.

          When should I use high fidelity design tools?
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          If you’ve recognised a gap in our system, feel free to use traditional
          high fidelity design tools to define that new experience. However,
          when doing so, you should be mindful not to inadvertently redesign
          existing patterns.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Always try to leverage lower level design elements such as colour,
          spacing, typography and iconography. If you need help designing new
          patterns, reach out in {braidDesignSupportLink} to see if we can offer
          any assistance.

        <Heading level="3">Won’t this slow us down?</Heading>
        <Text>The goal is to actually let you design faster!</Text>
        <Text>
          If working in {playroomLink} is too slow, that’s probably a sign that
          either our design system is incomplete, or that we’re creating too
          many new patterns. It’s important that we discuss these issues early
          in the design process where we have more opportunity to fix them.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Of course, this means that we may be slower in certain scenarios, but
          it’s an opportunity for us to invest in design standards that will
          continue to speed us up over the long term.
        </Text>

        <Heading level="3">What if I need some help?</Heading>
        <Text>
          We recommend reaching out in our {braidDesignSupportLink} Slack
          channel. We’ll be more than happy to work with you to make sure that
          you’re comfortable working in this environment.
        </Text>

        <Heading level="3">What if my designs look different to Braid?</Heading>
        <Text>
          A design system’s job is to help standardise the look and feel of an
          entire product suite, not to match individual concept designs
          pixel-for-pixel. It’s a good idea to start by iterating on your design
          in {playroomLink} to try alternative approaches.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          You should be open to changing minor details that aren’t critical to
          the success of the product. The goal is to solve the end user’s
          problem, not to perfectly match an existing concept design.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          However, it’s natural that most designs will feature some degree of
          customisation that isn’t officially supported within the existing
          system. You may even be using a pattern that is unique to your
          product. Don’t feel like every single component needs to exist in
          Braid.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          It’s also possible that you’re using a pattern that should ideally be
          in Braid but hasn’t been built yet. In this case, it’s best to have a
          quick chat in {braidDesignSupportLink} so we can give you personalised
          advice on how best to move forwards.
        </Text>

        <Heading level="3">How do I add a new component to Braid?</Heading>
        <Text>
          Don’t get too hung up on adding new components to Braid. If you think
          a pattern is worth sharing outside of your team, let us know in{' '}
          {braidDesignSupportLink}, but don’t let this get in the way of
          shipping real value to your users.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Braid components have a very high bar of quality due to accessibility
          requirements and their widespread usage across different products and
          brands. As a result, it’s likely that your existing work will need to
          be revisited once we start standardising it.
        </Text>

        <Heading level="3">What if I need a new component right away?</Heading>
        <Text>
          Generally speaking, you should never be blocked waiting for Braid.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Our job is to standardise existing patterns, not to hold back new
          ones. Your team should be perfectly capable of writing new components
          and custom styling within your project, and you should always err on
          the side of delivery. Your users are ultimately the number one
          priority.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          When you inevitably create something new, it’s a good idea to let us
          know in {braidDesignSupportLink} so that we can keep an eye out for
          emerging patterns and work towards standardised solutions.
