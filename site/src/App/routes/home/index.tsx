        ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Braid, the themeable design system for the{' '}

      <Text>
        Braid aims to make cross-brand UI development as fast as possible while
        maintaining a high level of quality and accessibility. In order to
        achieve this, Braid provides as a set of{' '}
        <TextLink href="https://reactjs.org/">React</TextLink> components and{' '}
        <TextLink href="https://seek-oss.github.io/treat/">treat</TextLink>{' '}
        themes.

      <Heading level="3">What makes Braid different</Heading>
      <Text>
        As much as possible, we want Braid code to make sense to non-developers.
        We&rsquo;re aggressively focused on the simplicity and composability of
        its API.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Along with our work on{' '}
        <TextLink href="https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom">
          Playroom
        </TextLink>
        , our goal is to empower designers and developers to iterate together in
        the same medium using the same components, reducing the need for high
        fidelity mock ups before development starts. We want to allow you to
        spend less time polishing mock ups and more time polishing the product.
        For more information about our philosophy, check out our{' '}
        <TextLink href="/guides/design-workflow">
          design workflow guide

      <Heading level="3">Getting started</Heading>
      <Text>
        First, we recommend reading the{' '}
        <TextLink href="/guides/design-workflow">design workflow</TextLink> and{' '}
        <TextLink href="/guides/development-workflow">
          development workflow
        </TextLink>{' '}
        guides. These capture our current views on how best to make use of Braid
        in your daily work.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Next, you should read our{' '}
        <TextLink href="/foundations/layout">layout guide</TextLink>. This goes
        into detail about how we manage component composition and layout, which
        forms the backbone of our system.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Then, read our{' '}
        <TextLink href="/foundations/tones">tones guide</TextLink> to get an
        understanding of the common set of tones (positive, critical, etc.) used
        throughout Braid.

        Finally, there&rsquo;s really no substitute for looking at all the
        available components, so just jump right in and start looking around. As
        you explore, you should familiarise yourself with our{' '}
        <TextLink href={playroomUrl}>Braid Playroom</TextLink> which allows you
        to try out the components without requiring a development environment.

      <Heading level="3">Support</Heading>
      <Text>
        If you work at SEEK, we have a couple of internal Slack channels
        dedicated to support. For design related questions, head to
        #braid-design-support. For more technical questions, direct them to
        #braid-support. We try to respond to everyone as quickly as we can, and
        we&rsquo;re always happy to help.
