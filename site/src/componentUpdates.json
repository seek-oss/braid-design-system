Even though this is unlikely to affect anyone (a `TextLink` without an `href` isn't terribly useful), this is still technically a breaking change.\n\n    However, if you find an instance of `TextLink` that you think _shouldn't_ have an `href`, this is a sign that it's not _actually_ a link and you should use a [`TextLinkRenderer`](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/TextLinkRenderer) instead. Unfortunately, because there's no way for us to know the semantics of your usage ahead of time, we're unable to provide a migration guide, so you'll need to be mindful of how this might impact accessibility.\n\n-   The props for `TextLink` now extend React's `AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>` type rather than `AllHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>`. While highly unlikely, this may cause type errors if you've passed props to `TextLink` that aren't considered to be valid anchor props."}]},{"version":"24.4.1","updates":[{"updated":["Divider"],"summary":"Divider: Rename 'standard' weight to 'regular'."}]},{"version":"24.4.0","updates":[{"updated":["Divider"],"summary":"Divider: Add strong weight variant, e.g. `<Divider weight=\"strong\">`.\n\nNote that this also affects the `dividers` prop on both `Stack` and `Tiles`, e.g. `<Stack space=\"medium\" dividers=\"strong\">`.
