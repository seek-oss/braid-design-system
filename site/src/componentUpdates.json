This will have subtle white space changes throughout the UI, but will largely just be improvements to the balance of space around text.\n\n**BREAKING CHANGES**\n\n**Heading/Text: Removed _LEGACY_SPACE_**\n\nThe `_LEGACY_SPACE_` prop was provided to support consumers migrating to [`v14`](https://github.com/seek-oss/braid-design-system/releases/tag/v14.0.0) when the white space cropping and layout components were originally introduced. This has now been removed to allow us to further improve on our approach.\n\nMigrating off this prop will require consumers to perform the following steps:\n\n-   Remove the usage of `_LEGACY_SPACE_` on a component\n-   Conduct a visual review of the impact (component will appear closer to neighbouring elements)\n-   Use existing layout components, e.g. `Stack`, to define/control the reintroduction of the desired space.\n\nAny issues, please reach out to the team as we are happy to help support consumers in migrating.\n\n**Theme Tokens: Text and Heading definitions**\n\nThere have been strutural theme changes for `heading` and `text` definitions to support the defining of `capHeight` in the system. Previously a definition contained `size` that was the specified font size inclusive of surrounding white space.\n\nA definition now has `capHeight` which is representative of the visual height, supporting improved alignment with other elements like, icons etc.\n\n```diff\n{\n  text: {\n    standard: {\n      mobile: {\n-        size: 16,\n+        capHeight: 11.43,\n        rows: 6\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis is not likely to affect consumers, unless these theme values are used explicitly in custom treat files.\n\n**Theme Tokens: Descender and Cap Height scales**\n\nInstead of the calculated values of `capHeightScale` and `decenderHeightScale`, a theme now accepts `fontMetrics`—a structure that represents the metadata from the font itself.\n\n```diff\n-const capHeight = 24 * theme.typography.capHeightScale;\n+const capHeight = 24 * (theme.typography.fontMetrics.capHeight / theme.typography.fontMetrics.unitsPerEm);\n```\n\n```diff\n-const descender = 24 * theme.typography.decenderHeightScale;\n+const descender = 24 * (Math.abs(theme.typography.fontMetrics.descent) / theme.typography.fontMetrics.unitsPerEm);\n```"

For example, if you wanted to ensure that all relative links are [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) links:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Link as ReactRouterLink } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { BraidProvider, LinkComponent } from 'braid-design-system';\nimport wireframe from 'braid-design-system/themes/wireframe';\n\n// First create the custom link implementation:\nconst CustomLink: LinkComponent = ({ href, ...restProps }) =>\n  href[0] === '/' ? (\n    <ReactRouterLink to={href} {...restProps} />\n  ) : (\n    <a href={href} {...restProps} />\n  );\n\n// Then pass it to BraidProvider:\nexport const App = () => (\n  <BraidProvider theme={wireframe} linkComponent={CustomLink}>\n    ...\n  </BraidProvider>\n);\n```\n\nIn order to make your custom link component available for any type of link (not just usages of `TextLink`), this release introduces a new `Link` component which renders an unstyled `a` tag by default.\n\n**BREAKING CHANGES**\n\n-   `TextLink` now requires an `href` prop. Even though this is unlikely to affect anyone (a `TextLink` without an `href` isn't terribly useful), this is still technically a breaking change.\n\n    However, if you find an instance of `TextLink` that you think _shouldn't_ have an `href`, this is a sign that it's not _actually_ a link and you should use a [`TextLinkRenderer`](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/TextLinkRenderer) instead. Unfortunately, because there's no way for us to know the semantics of your usage ahead of time, we're unable to provide a migration guide, so you'll need to be mindful of how this might impact accessibility.\n\n-   The props for `TextLink` now extend React's `AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>` type rather than `AllHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>`. While highly unlikely, this may cause type errors if you've passed props to `TextLink` that aren't considered to be valid anchor props."
