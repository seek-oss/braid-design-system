**Drawer:** Prevent close button protruding in left position

Fixes an issue where the close button could protrude from a `Drawer`.
This was only visible when setting `position` to `left` and between a small range of screen widths â€” above 660px (`small` content width) and below 768px (`tablet` breakpoint).
