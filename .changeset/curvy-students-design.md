**IconPromote:** Update semantic icon from sparkles to a megaphone

With the introduction of `IconAI` recently adopting the sparkles artwork (aligning with the industry trend), the `IconPromote` semantic is now updated to use a megaphone instead of sparkles.

This change will run through all semantic usages, for example `Alert`, `Notice`, etc.
