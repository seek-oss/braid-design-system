**useBreakpoint:** Remove deprecated Hook

This Hook has been deprecated since [v30.1.0] in favour of `useResponsiveValue`, to prevent consumers from inadvertently coupling themselves to the current set of breakpoints, making it risky for us to introduce new breakpoints.

See the [migration guide] for more information.

[v30.1.0]: https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/useBreakpoint/releases/#v30.1.0
