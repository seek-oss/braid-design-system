**useToast**: Improve layout of toasts when multiple toasts are shown

When multiple toasts are shown simultaneously, they now visually stack in a collapsed format that expands on interaction.
This prevents toasts from obscuring page content while providing users with an easy way to manage and navigate through the recent toast history.
