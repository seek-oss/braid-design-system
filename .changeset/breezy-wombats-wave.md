**Textarea:** Highlight excess characters when `characterLimit` is provided, support opting out via `highlightExcessCharacters` prop

All characters entered beyond the specified character limit will now be visually highlighted. You can optionally disable this behaviour by setting the `highlightExcessCharacters` prop to `false`.
