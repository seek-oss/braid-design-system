**Button, ButtonLink:** Remove weight prop

Removing support for the `weight` prop. This was deprecated back in [v29.26.0](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/releases#29.26.0) in favour of using the [`variant`](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Button#variants) prop.
