Add Braid 'docs-ui' package to the Braid Docs Site for usage.

As part of a larger effort to migrate the Docs Site components to the Braid 'docs-ui' package:
* Migrate usage of the **LinkableHeading** component from Braid `src` to Braid `docs-ui` package.
* Remove the no longer used **LinkableHeading** component from Braid `src`.
