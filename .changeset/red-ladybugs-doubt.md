**Stack:** Set default text alignment based on `align`

As a convenience, the `align` prop sets the text alignment for the container, meaning any nested `Text` or `Heading` components will inherit this alignment by default.

This can be overridden by setting the alignment explicitly on the relevant `Text` or `Heading` component.
