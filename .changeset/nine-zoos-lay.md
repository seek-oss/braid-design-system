Update Braid layout components to use modern CSS features. This improves performance, developer experience, and maintainability.

**MIGRATION GUIDE:**

Layout components may no longer work as expected on the following browser versions:

- Chrome 83 and below,
- Edge 83 and below,
- Safari 14.0 and below, and
- Firefox 62 and below.

In order to mitigate potential disruptions to the user experience, consumers should consider their user base on these browser versions when upgrading Braid.
