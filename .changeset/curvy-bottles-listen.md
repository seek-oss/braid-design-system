**theme:** Add support for defining line heights with lineGap

Provide support for themes to define their typographic line heights via `lineGap`.
This allows us to reason about the white space between wrapping lines of text in the same way we think about `Stack` spacing.

For a visual preview of this mental model head over to the [Capsize website].
