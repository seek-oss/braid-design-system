**seekJobs:** Change link colour to neutral

Changing the `foregroundColor` token for `link` on the `seekJobs` theme to align with neutral text.
Our different approach to using colour has seen links dialled back to compete less with other messaging and CTAs.

This affects the following usages across the system:
- `vars.foregroundColor.link`
- `Text` (using `tone="link"`)
- `TextLink` and (`TextLinkButton`)
