**PageBlock:** Add `small` and `full` width options

Add `small` to available `width` options of `PageBlock` to support narrower max width for page content.

Also introducing `full` as a `width` option to enable full width content, while still maintaining consistent screen gutters.

**EXAMPLE USAGE:**
```jsx
<PageBlock width="small">
  ...
</PageBlock>
```
