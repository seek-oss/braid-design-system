**useToast:** Design uplift with increased page contrast

As a means to increase constrast against page content, the design has been updated to be presented on inverted backgrounds based on the color mode.
The design has also be refined to remove the sidebar/keyline (consistent with `Alert`), while also applying the `tone` to the provided `message`.
