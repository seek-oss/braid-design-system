Update semantic icon assets.

`IconPromote`: Move from sparkle to megaphone. Enables introduction of `IconAI` to adopt a sparkles variation.
`IconCritical`: Move from circle to diamond outline. Increase the visual distinction from `IconInfo`.
`IconLanguage`: Move from globe to characters. Better represents the concept of language. Previous asset available as `IconGlobe`.


**MIGRATION GUIDE**

As the above are updates to semantics icons, consumers are unaffected if their usage follows the icons semantic intent.
For those choosing the icon based on its visual appearance, please review the usage and consider decoupling from the semantic system icon for safer upgrades.
