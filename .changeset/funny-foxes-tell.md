**MonthPicker:** Fix internal `<Hidden screen>` deprecation warning

The `MonthPicker` component was mistakenly using `<Hidden screen>` to provide labels to screen readers rather than the new [`HiddenVisually`](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/HiddenVisually) component. As a result, deprecation warnings were being logged in the console during development.
