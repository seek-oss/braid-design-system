**Autosuggest:** Add `filterSuggestions` function, allow `suggestions` prop to be a function

The logic for filtering suggestions typically lives on the server rather than the client because itâ€™s impractical to send all possible suggestions over the network. However, when prototyping in Playroom or working with smaller datasets, you may want to perform this filtering on the client instead. For this case, we now provide a `filterSuggestions` function to make this as painless as possible.

To better support this behaviour, you can now pass a function to the `suggestions` prop. When executed, this function will be passed the current `value` of the field.

**EXAMPLE USAGE**

```tsx
import { Autosuggest, filterSuggestions } from 'braid-design-system';

<Autosuggest
  suggestions={filterSuggestions([
    { text: 'Apples', value: 1 },
    { text: 'Bananas', value: 2 }
  ])}
  {...restProps}
  />
```
