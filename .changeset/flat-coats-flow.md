**ContentBlock:** Add support for left alignment

Introduces horizontal alignment support for `ContentBlock`, enabling content to be constrained to a max width and aligned to the left.

Useful inside of larger `PageBlock` or `ContentBlock` elements when constraining the content for readability or length of form fields.

**EXAMPLE USAGE:**
```jsx
<ContentBlock align="left">
  ...
</ContentBlock>
```
