**Text, Heading:** Increase icon size inside typographic elements

The size of icons has been increased by 20% when used inside of `Text` and `Heading` components. There is no layout impact expected for consumers, with only the visual ratio of icon to text size changing.

This applies to icons using the new `icon` slots, as well as inline icons within the text content.

> Icons used outside of typographic elements are not affected by this change.
