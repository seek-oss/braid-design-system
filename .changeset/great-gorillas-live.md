Show `description` on form fields when no `label` provided

Previously, a `FieldLabel` without a `label` would return nothing. However, now that form fields can opt for [indirect or hidden labels] (via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`), the `description` should still be shown if provided.

> Note: The `secondaryLabel` and `tertiaryLabel` remain conditional based on the presence of a `label`. This is due to their location in the layout being anchored off the `label`.

**EXAMPLE USAGE:**
```jsx
<FieldLabel
  description="Description now visible without label"
/>
```
