- how to call the codemods if they are moved to another package?
  e.g. "bin": {
  "braid-upgrade": "./codemod/dist/index.js"
  },

- What to do with playroom code

  - Need to consider metropolis

- Review .npmignore
- Fill out codemod/package.json
- Set up NX so we can run tsc inside each package (and do other monorepo stuff)
- Try and cache icon generation with NX
