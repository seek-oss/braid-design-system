# Welcome to the official FEP Jira Cloud™️ instance

## TODO

- how to call the codemods if they are moved to another package?
  e.g. "bin": {
  "braid-upgrade": "./codemod/dist/index.js"
  },

- What to do with playroom code

  - Need to consider metropolis

- Review .npmignore
- Fill out codemod/package.json
- Improve NX setup (caching, etc.)
- Ensure package deployments still work

- Will we have separate changelogs, or 1 combined one?
- changelog.js will be affected by this decision (I think)
- Will anything else be affected by there being multiple packages?
