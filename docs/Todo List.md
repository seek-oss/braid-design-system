# Todo List

## Component Migration

If you urgently need any of the following, please let us know in the `#braid-support` channel.

Please note that, while there may be existing implementations of these in other design systems, we are planning to revisit each API.

- Icons
- [`Autosuggest`](https://seek-oss.github.io/seek-style-guide/autosuggest)
- [`Badge`](https://seek-oss.github.io/seek-style-guide/badge)
- [`Loader`](https://seek-oss.github.io/seek-style-guide/loader)
- [`MonthPicker`](https://seek-oss.github.io/seek-style-guide/monthpicker)
- [`Pill`](https://seek-oss.github.io/seek-style-guide/pill)
- [`Rating`](https://seek-oss.github.io/seek-style-guide/rating)
- [`SlideToggle`](https://seek-oss.github.io/seek-style-guide/slidetoggle)

## Research and Development

If you have strong opinions on any of the following, please reach out in the `#braid-contributors` channel.

- Screen layout and white space management, with a focus on building strong layout primitives. We currently have [`Box`](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Box) and [`Columns`](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Columns), but we need more.
- Cross-brand headers and footers. We'd prefer a unified, themeable header and footer, but we'll still need to figure out a strategy for managing shared brand-specific elements in the meantime.
