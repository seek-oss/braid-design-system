## Research and Development

If you have strong opinions on any of the following, please reach out in the `#braid-contributors` channel.

- Cross-brand headers and footers. We'd prefer a unified, themeable header and footer, but we'll still need to figure out a strategy for managing shared brand-specific elements in the meantime.
