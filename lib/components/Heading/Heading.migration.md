# Heading Migration Guide

## API Changes

- Extracted from `Text` into a standalone component.
- Deprecated all existing size and weight variants in favour of `level={'1' | '2' | '3'}` and `weight={'regular' | 'weak'}`. Please note that this is a breaking change to our design language. When migrating, try to match existing styling as much as possible in consultation with your local designer.
- Now renders the appropriate `h1`/`h2`/`h3` tag by default. Please be aware that this may change existing page semantics. This can be overridden with the `component` prop, e.g. `<Heading level="3" component="h2">`.
- Now renders additional white space underneath. As a result, it's likely that you'll be able to remove custom styling in your application that was adding this space manually.
- Removed `baseline={boolean}`.
- No longer accepts arbitrary DOM properties, e.g. `className`. Please check that everything you need is exposed via the [public API.](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Heading)

- `tone={string}`
