# Contribution Guide

## Adding a new feature?

**Please let us know in Slack before you start working.** This lets us provide guidance before you spend too much time on it.

**If you've already done the work, you should still let us know in Slack before opening the PR.** This give us the opportunity to provide feedback on the direction early, making the PR process run more smoothly.

## Fixing a bug?

**Feel free to open a PR, but please take care to properly explain the issue.** We want to know what behaviour you were expecting, what went wrong and why, how your solution works at a technical level.

## Don't work at SEEK?

**Please consider this repo read-only.** We're happy for you to follow along with our our work, copy it, fork it, ask us questions on Twitter, etc. but we're also wanting to minimise the overhead of managing contributions.
