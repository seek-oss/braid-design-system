# Contribution Guide

## Adding a new feature?

**Please let us know in Slack before you start working.** This lets us provide guidance before you spend too much time on it.

**If you've already done the work, you should still let us know in Slack before opening the PR.** This give us the opportunity to provide feedback on the direction early, making the PR process run more smoothly.

## Fixing a bug?

**Feel free to open a PR, but please take care to properly explain the issue.** We want to know what behaviour you were expecting, what went wrong and why, how your solution works at a technical level.

## Don't work at SEEK?

**Please consider this repo read-only.** We're happy for you to follow along with our work, copy it, fork it, ask us questions on Twitter, etc. but we're also wanting to minimise the overhead of managing contributions.
